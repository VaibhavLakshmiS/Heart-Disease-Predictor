## Heart Disease Predictor Model: DS3 Datathon Project

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Heart Predictor Model, developed as part of the DS3 Datathon. 
This project represents our team's journey in exploring and predicting heart disease using advanced data science techniques 

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using a weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and Logistic Regression
The model is trained on a dataset that includes various health metrics, and it employs advanced data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning
to achieve higher accuracy.

## Repository Structure
- `heart_train.csv`: The training dataset.
- `heart_test.csv`: The test dataset (optional).
- `heart_disease.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the model training, validation, and testing code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.
